This repository contains the code that I wrote for Professor Fontaine's Financial Signal Processing course at The Cooper Union.
The following MATLAB files correspond to the respective assignments: 
      (1) Binomial_Asset_Pricing_Model.m 
      (2) Brownian_Motion.m 
      (3) StochasticCalculus.m 
      (4) SparsePortfolio.m 
      (5) TimeSeriesAnalysis.m
The CSV files are all required in order to run the scripts/perform the data analysis.
